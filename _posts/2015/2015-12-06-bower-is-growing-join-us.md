Over the past month, Webfly has seen **88 commits**, **75 closed issues**, **34 wiki edits** and **2 releases** from **27 contributors** spread across **15 timezones**. Amazing.

But here's the *really* impressive part: Nearly all those contributors had never touched Webfly's codebase until just a few weeks ago when Adam and Dave [asked for help](/blog/2015/webfly-alive-looking-contributors/). Developers eagerly responded and immediately began triaging issues, writing documentation and fixing bugs. Not only is Webfly now more stable and feature-rich, it now has a community supporting it.

As with many open source projects, we're fortunate to be standing on the shoulders of giants. Webfly was handcrafted by some [incredibly talented developers](https://github.com/wbfly/webfly/graphs/contributors). As the project moves forward, it's exciting to know the number of contributors will continue to grow.

Today we're releasing [v1.7.0](https://github.com/wbfly/webfly/releases/tag/v1.7.0) which includes fixes and enhancements that have been on Webfly's radar for years.
