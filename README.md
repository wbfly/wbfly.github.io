# webfly.io

Documentation for [Webfly](https://webfly.io)

The site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 2.x and served with GitHub Pages.

``` bash
# install npm packages
npm install
# run any tasks
grunt
# install jekyll (You may need sudo here)
gem install jekyll
gem install jekyll-paginate
# serve site to view locally
jekyll serve
```

### Docker support

You can build a docker image to serve the site instead of installing Jekyll in
your development environment

``` bash
# build the image
docker build -t webfly-io .
# install the npm packages
docker run -t -v $(pwd):/opt/code:rw --rm webfly-io npm install
# run any tasks
docker run -t -v $(pwd):/opt/code:rw --rm webfly-io grunt
```

You can run the `jekyll server` with the next command:

``` bash
docker run --rm -ti -p 4000:4000 -v $(pwd):/opt/code:rw webfly-io jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

You can access the server via http://127.0.0.1:4000
